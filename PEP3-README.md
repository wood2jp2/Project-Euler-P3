DIRECTIONS: 

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?

PERSONAL NOTES: 

This one was a challenge. I figured I would have to set up a couple of variables, with the counter (i) being relatively obvious. I assigned the number to a text variable just for flow and ease of code. At first, I tried to tackle this using a 'while' loop, yet for some reason I couldn't crack it. I switched to a for loop with an if statement embedded, which seemed much easier. Using modulo, I was able to track which numbers were prime factors of the number, and continue iterating until we got to the number, logging those to the console as we went. The answer to this problem is 20028382381.

I really enjoyed watching this work, as I at first thought I crashed my browser! As the iteration continues, and starts to solve the final three to four stages of factors, it really does take 5-25 minutes for it to compute the next number.
